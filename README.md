## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a network engineer by trade and am passionate about making things more efficient. Python is my language of choice though I've worked in C# and various other languages in a smaller capacity.

Self-hosting applications is always exciting and it's great to hear about new and fun Docker containers to try.

## About me

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on improving my Python and network automation skills
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about managing networks with Nautobot
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on networking automation, Python, and docker projects
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for fun new self-hosted/docker containers/images
- ðŸ˜„ I'm excited to help work on open source projects. Let me know if I can help!
